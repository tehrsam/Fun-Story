Chapter 1: Magical Macalester Maggie
Once upon a time there was a Macalester student named Maggie.
She was extremely bored and never had any interesting adventures outside of the Mac bubble.
One day, her Comp 225 professor told the class that they were going on a field trip
The bus was supposed to leave from Grand Ave at 6:00 A.M. on Tue.
On Tuesday, Maggie woke up well rested, but she looked at her clock and it said 6:05!
Maggie sprinted over the Grand Ave and saw the school Bus! "Yay!" yelled Maggie
"I'm not too late"
Maggie ran over and hopped on the school bus, which inmedietly closed the doors and drove away.
Maggie looked at the people on the school bus and said "What!"
